## Project Description
I decided to give it a go and try to make a simple hangman game. 

## Rules
Player has to guess in six attempts the name of a film consisting only of a-z characters.

## Workflow
I first decided which variables I need (list of films, number of attempts…)
The next step was to think of the functions that are necessary (e.g. a function that allows the player to input a character, a function that defines how the game goes)
The final step was to run the execution using the variables and functions.

## Organization
I used jupyter notebook and visual studio for writing the code. I was testing the game by activating it from the command line.  
My repository consists of three files:jupyter notebook, python file and a readme file.
